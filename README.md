## Testing

Methodically and systematically manually tested UX/User Experience through all pages and specifically ensuring that foreground information isn't distracted by the Background Image;
Navigation Bar, Index/Home Page Callout, Footer/Social Media Icons/Buttons, About Page, Projects Page/Cards and Contact Page are consistent in style and color and allows users to initiate and control actions

### Specifically tested Contact Page:
1. Attempted to send a message with empty form and empty input fields and verified error message.
2. Attempted to submit form with an invalid email address and verified error message.
3. Submitted the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

Tested all pages on different browsers and screen sizes when possible.

Found the site works well, how intended and will allow potential employers, recruiters and future collaborators a simple and accurate portfolio of Ant Romano's Full Stack Software Development skills and experience.
